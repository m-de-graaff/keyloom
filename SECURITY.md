# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate reports from the community.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- Please email: security@keyloom.dev
- Include a detailed description, reproduction steps, and impacted versions
- You should receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours
- We aim to provide a fix or mitigation timeline and coordinated disclosure plan

## Scope

- All packages in this repository (`@keyloom/*`)
- Authentication flows, crypto primitives, adapters, and server routes

## Do not

- Do not create public GitHub issues for security reports
- Do not test against production systems without permission

## Supported versions

We generally patch the latest minor versions of maintained packages. Older, unmaintained versions may receive best-effort advisories only.

## Coordinated disclosure

- We will work with you on a reasonable disclosure timeline
- Credit is given in release notes (optional)

## Safe harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith research and disclosure that follows this policy and avoids privacy violations, data exfiltration, or service disruption.
